                CASH WAQF SUKUK FOR POVERTY ALLEVIATION
              </h2>

              <p>
                Cash Waqf Sukuk (CWS) is an innovative financing mechanism that
                aims to mobilize resources through the issuance of sukuk
                (Sharia-compliant bonds). The funds generated from the Sukuk
                will be invested, and the proceeds will be transferred to the
                Islamic Solidarity Fund for Development (ISFD), the poverty
                alleviation arm of the Islamic Development Bank (IsDB). A unique
                feature of CWS is that profit generated from the investment of
                these Sukuk is directed to poverty alleviation programs rather
                than the Sukuk holders – (henceforth “benefactors”).
                Subscription to CWS is not restricted to Muslims only, it is
                open to all partners interested in committing part of their
                resources for poverty alleviation purposes.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Sharia Board of the IsDB cleared the CWS, concept, and the
                ISFD Board has approved the issuance of up to US$500 MILLION of
                Sukuk, with an expected initial issuance of US$200 million in
                2020".The CWS's specificity is that it targets both high net
                worth individuals and members of the public who can subscribe
                with as little as US$100. The CWS has a 10-year retention period
                before the principal amount is paid back to the Sukuk holders.
                CWS are "social instruments" whose sole purpose is to seek out
                interested philanthropists who would provide Waqf (endowment) in
                form of cash. Upon maturity of the Sukuk, the benefactors will
                get back their initial cash contributions.

              </h2>
              <p>
                There are at least 28 million Out of School Children in the
                Member Countries of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation
                (OIC). The proceeds realized from Cash Waqf Sukuk will be
                directed to fund the Out of School Children Program in OIC
                Countries. IsDB/ISFD has signed a declaration with other
                development partners such as Save the Children, UK, Global
                Partnership for Education, Spark, International Federation of
                Red Cross and Red Crescent, Education Can not Wait, Light for
                the World, as well as the UN Special Envoy on Education and
                former British Prime Minister, Rt. Hon. Gordon Brown, to enroll
                all out-of-school children and youth in the OIC Countries back
                to school by 2030. This would contribute greatly to achieving
                the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), especially SDG-4 on
                quality education and lifelong learning for all.

              <p>
                The Islamic Development Bank (IsDB) is a major leader in
                international development with a niche in Islamic finance. In
                its over four decades of development financing, IsDB has
                impacted the lives in every corner of the globe by serving its
                57 Member Countries and Muslim Communities in non-Member
                Countries.
              </p>
              <p>
                In the education sector alone, where profits generated from Cash
                Waqf Sukuk will be used to return and retain Out-of-School
                Children, IsDB has financed more than 2000 projects worth US $5
                billion in 136 countries. Through its flagship scholarships
                program introduced in 1981, IsDB has sponsored more than 17,000
                students to pursue various educational trainings at top
                universities around the world. While the bank is proud of this
                achievement, it also understands the need to come up with new
                initiatives for resource mobilization to consolidate the
                achievements of the past and ensure sustainability of its
                development interventions in the future.
              </p>
              <p>
                In light of this, IsDB President, Dr. Bandar Hajjar, after
                assuming the leadership of the IsDB in October 2016, launched a
                new road map that will provide a framework for projects of IsDB.
                The new business model, known as the President’s 5-Year Program
                (P5P), is premised on 6 key performance drivers .

                Cash Waqf Sukuk is a transformative method of Crowdsourcing

              <p>
                I am thrilled that the Islamic Development Bank is taking the
                initiative to return Out-of-School Children and to use creative
                financial mechanism including the endowment concept as a noble
                Islamic based way to achieve this very bold goal. I think this
                is an ingenious idea and I want to get behind it, support it,
                and promote it. It is ingenious for many reasons. One is that it
                taps into a fundamental pillar and culture and Islamic belief.
                So, it is a form of giving for the common good. Second, unlike a
                normal development aid, the cash endowment that is being
                proposed will be 10-years of systematic flow. This is much
                better than a normal aid project which gives aid a year at a
                time, and then each year you have to scramble to try to make the
                next budget; here you have 10-years to be able to make a
                profound transformation in the local education system. I think
                this is an extremely innovative approach. Third, this is a kind
                of modern crowdsourcing, because this is an invitation to the
                richest people who indeed should do more, but everybody also to
                put in a small amount, because this funding will tap to small
                contribution for those with modest means, as well a very large
                contribution for those of major means. The bank is offering an
                ingenious and powerful mechanism.
              </p>
              <p>
                In this endowment scheme, individuals, both the large wealth
                holders and average people will put money into this new fund, it
                will generate income for 10-years to enable children
                Out-of-School to have a place in school, a seat in the classroom
                with a qualified teacher and to be learning the skills and
                empowerment they need for our knowledge economy. At the end of
                10-years those who have contributed can draw their funds or they
                can decide to make their funding as a permanent endowment. I
                believe that this is transformative in giving a long time
                perspective for development, in harnessing the endowment concept
                in Islamic finance for achieving sustainable development goal
                number 4, and I believe that this will mobilize huge interest
                and huge financing for phenomenal benefit for the children of
                the Islamic world. I couldn’t be more excited to learn about
                this initiative and its enormous promise.

              <p>
                Community participation plays a key role in the implementation
                of development projects. Kalley-Plateau primary school in the
                outskirts of the city of Niamey in the Republic of Niger has a
                unique story. The community came together and constructed
                makeshift classes in a land provided by the government so that
                their children could have access to primary education. During
                the Workshop on Out-of-School Children organized by the Islamic
                Solidarity Fund for Development with other development partners
                in January 2020, the participants paid a historic visit to the
                school and engaged with the community to understand their
                challenges and initiate ways of working together to help the
                community achieve their dreams of providing quality education
                for their children. Saleh Idi is the leader of the community
                that established the school and he expressed his expectations on
                the Out-of-School Children initiative
              </p>

                My name is Saleh Idi and I am the President of Parents’
                Association of Kalley-Plateau primary school and I am one of the
                Qur’anic teachers in the school. Historically there was no
                school in this area, and the community was growing. The parents
                come together every year to make contribution for the funding of
                the school. The government provide teachers while the community
                provide the structure and the equipment needed. It is a very
                good school and the community is working hard, but lack of
                equipment is a major challenge which affects the quality of
                education. For instance there is no furniture for the pupils to
                sit and study

                Here are around 570 pupils in this school from class 1-6. The
                school had been in operation for the last 8 years. We have to
                split the classes to be held in the morning and late afternoon.
                Therefore, we are running 11 classes with this arrangement.
                There are 40-50 students per classroom. Before the classes have
                about 100 pupils. The government is responsible for paying
                teachers’ salaries. The community's role is to provide space for
                teaching and required facilities, including drinking water. This
                year a secondary school was established, but it was far from
                here, it’s a day school with three classes. Once our pupils
                finish grade 6, they transfer to the new school.

                GULF INVESTORS WELCOME THE INTRODUCTION OF $500 MILLION CASH
                WAQF SUKUK BY ISDB
              </h3>
              <p>
                At the third Gulf investors Gulf Debt Capital Market Summit in
                Dubai – UAE, Gulf investors welcomed the initiative of Islamic
                Development Bank (IsDB) to offer US$500 million Cash Waqf Sukuk
                (CWS). The Summit was organized by the Gulf Bond and Sukuk
                Association (GBSA) on 25 October 2019. Brs. Fawaz Abdulnour,
                Officer-in-Charge, Crowd Engagement & Funds Management
                Department (CEEFM), and Ben Ousmane Ba, Lead Funds Management
                Specialist from the Partnerships Development Complex,
                represented the IsDB at the Summit.
              </p>
              <p>
                Fawaz noted that the introduction of CWS is part of the
                innovative resource mobilization effort promoted by IsDB. The
                IsDB new business model championed by IsDB President Dr. Bandar
                Hajjar, emphasizes the need for innovative initiatives to
                maximize the impact of IsDB interventions in Member Countries.
              </p>
              <p>
                Following the endorsement of CWS by the IsDB Shari’ah Board, the
                ISFD Board of Directors approved the issuance of CWS in February
                2019 to the tune of US$500 million, with an initial issuance of
                up to US$200 million. As a resource mobilization tool, CWS
                targets all categories of benefactors (High-Net-Worth
                individuals as well as members of the public), to subscribe to
                the Sukuk. Proceeds will be invested, and the profit will be
                directed towards ISFD/IsDB poverty alleviation programs
              </p>

              <p class="green-para">
                "CWS are social instruments where the benefactors donate the
                earned profit for poverty alleviation purposes. During the life
                of the sukuk or upon maturity, the benefactors have the option
                to convert their temporary into a permanent Cash Waqf,” Br.
                Fawaz said. “We are pleased with this innovative financing
                mechanism, which is expected to be launched in 2020. I am
                confident that CWS will be tool that will be a game changer in
                support of the IsDB efforts to ensure"

                Reading some information about poverty alleviation, you might
                think that poverty is exclusively a problem of the Muslim World.
                although poverty is not an exclusive to the Muslim world, it is
                truly an alarming problem that should be treated as an emergency
                if SDG1, (No Poverty), is to be achieved by the year 2030
              </p>
              <p>
                Despite the flourishing nature of Islamic finance, which has an
                estimated US$2 trillion in assets, some experts argue that it
                has not effectively succeeded in generating economic activities
                that would lift the poor out of poverty. As of 2019 there were
                an estimated 320 million in the OIC countries living on less
                than US$1.9 per day.

                While this is an issue of huge concern, it is also a great
                opportunity for the IsDB to deploy its influence to overcome the
                threat of poverty in the Muslim World by accelerating the drive
                for poverty alleviation through the introduction of Cash Waqf
                Sukuk (CWS). CWS is an innovative resource mobilizing tool,
                whereby the proceeds from Sukuk issuance will be directed to
                Shari’ah-compliant investments, and the net returns from these
                investments will be entirely forfeited by the Sukuk holders in
                favor of the ISFD for its programs and operations. However, upon
                maturity of the Sukuk, subscribers receive back their
                principal/subscription amount.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Crowd Engagement and Funds Management Department (CEEFM)
                will lead the issuance of the Sukuk as part of a greater
                collaboration between IsDB’s Partnerships Development Complex
                and ISFD.
              </p>
              <p>
                Sukuk holders are not motivated by financial return. Instead,
                they focus on the delivery of sustainable social outcomes and
                philanthropic goals. The CWS effectively uses of Temporary Cash
                Waqf (TCW) and Permanent Cash Waqf (PCW). It includes built-in
                option for Sukuk-holders to convert their TCW into a PCW on
                maturity if they wish. The Sharia Board of IsDB approved the CWS
                concept, and the Board of Directors of ISFD approved the
                issuance of US$500 CWS, with an initial issuance of US$200
                million in 2020. The beauty of CWS is that it targets both
                High-Net-Worth-Individuals and members of the public who can
                subscribe for as little as US$100
              </p>
              <p>
                It is important to stress that CWS is a “social” service, unlike
                the conventional Sukuk where subscribers receive a financial
                return. CWS aims to alleviate the suffering of the poor, and to
                create jobs or income generation opportunities. The CWS tenure
                is set at 10 years before the principal payment is paid to TCW
                Sukuk holders.
              </p>
              <p>
                The UN estimates the gap in financing to achieve the SDGs at
                US$2.5 trillion annually in developing countries alone (UNCTAD,
                2014).” Reliance on conventional sources of finance will not be
                sufficient to achieve these Goals. Islamic finance, through
                innovative resource mobilization tools like CWS can take center
                stage in any forum discussing the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable
                Development.
